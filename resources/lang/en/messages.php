At the time of marriage, the dasa of the Kendra and Trikona lords should be in contact with at least one of the man and woman. If the dasa that gives bad results is in contact with, married life will be difficult even if there is compatibility in the horoscope. 3. If the dasa of hostile planets is in contact with both the horoscopes, disagreements and separation will increase.",

Except for those who manage to overcome this to some extent and succeed, the planets will indicate that there is a possibility of drowning in this kind of stress and getting into extreme stress. People with such planetary conjunctions need to keep their minds relaxed at all times. In today's mechanical life, since mental balance is also an indispensable and important thing for the success of married life, the level of this mental restlessness is calculated separately for both the grooms and based on that, this compatibility is accurately predicted.",
